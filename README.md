TomeDB is supposed to be a modern, novel database system that unites the strengths of relational databases and document stores/relational databases.

The ideas are as follows:

- Fixed table schemas, like in a relational database
- Allow array types and nested structs
- Compile-time query compilation at the application layer; communication with database via novel PQP (Procedual Query Protocol)
- Simple, modern and comfortable (no "varchar(256)", basically)
- Modern querying syntax
